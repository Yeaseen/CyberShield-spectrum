This lab is divided into three parts. Each part will require you to run tests.

- Part A: Configuring a Local Area Network (LAN) to host our small-business network
- Part B: Configuring a Wide Area Network (WAN) to simulate the internet
- Part C: Configuring Port Forwarding on the OpenWrt Router for the WebGoat VM so the Kali Linux VM in the WAN Can Access the WebGoat VM
